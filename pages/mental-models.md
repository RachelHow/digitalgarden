# Mental Models

A mental model is how your mind works/thinks. Mental models help you **optimise systems** (assessing how systems work) and how they help you make **better decisions**. It affects everything you do. Outliers use mental models to shape their thinking. Examples of outliers include Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Warren Buffett.

Growing up, we are accustomed to think like other people without questioning why things are done in a certain way. Resist the habit of following your gut/instincts and switch to mental models instead.

There are over 1,000 mental models in the world. Here are some mental models that I find interesting:
- [[first-principles]]
- [[local-global]]
- [[regret-minimisation]]
- [[pareto-principle]]
