# Mental Models

Growing up, we become accustomed to think like the others without questioning why things are done in a certain way. We then believe this is the way things are and do things the usual way, just like the others. How do we change that? By training our brains to think better.

To think better, expand the set of mental models we use to think.[^s1]

A mental model is how our mind works/thinks. Mental models help us **optimise systems** (assessing how systems work) and how they help us make **better decisions**. It affects everything we do.

Ever wondered what makes a person an outlier? Outliers use mental models to shape their thinking. They resist the habit of following the gut/instinctsâ€”they switch to mental models instead. Examples of outliers include Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Warren Buffett.

There are over 1,000 mental models in the world. Here are some mental models that I find interesting:
- [[first-principles]]
- [[local-global]]
- [[regret-minimisation]]
- [[pareto-principle]]
