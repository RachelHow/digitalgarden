# First Principles

Elon Musk explains first principles as: "What is the most efficient way to solve a problem if you started from scratch? If you look past humanityâ€™s attempts to solve it, what is the best approach if you reasoned back up from its fundamental principles?"

To apply this mental model, ask yourself:
- What system underlies this activity? Is it a relationship, a business, a product, or something else with multiple components depending on each other?
- Is this system efficient yet?
- If not, what are the underlying principles it relies on?  
- Can I restart from those principles to identify a remarkably better way to run this system?

To identify which system is worth optimising, use the second mental model: [[local-global]].
