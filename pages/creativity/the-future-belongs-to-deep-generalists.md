# The Future Belongs to Deep Generalists

Today's world calls for range, not specialisation. Trying to specialise in one thing may distract us from the ability to really excel at something.

A deep generalist is someone who has a useful blend of knowledge depth and knowledge breadth. Generalists are good at adapting. Changes, therefore, turn into opportunities.

The questions is, should we become specialists or polymaths? Is there a balance we should pursue? Every day, we have to decide where to invest our time — do we become better at what we do or learn something new?[^s1]

### Examples of great deep generalists:
- Elon Musk

### Reads on this topic:
- **Range** by David Epstein
  - “We learn who we are in practice, not in theory.”
  - “The challenge we all face is how to maintain the benefits of breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes, even demands, hyperspecialization”
  - “The precise person you are now is fleeting, just like all the other people you’ve been. That feels like the most unexpected result, but it is also the most well documented.”
  - “it is difficult to accept that the best learning road is slow, and that doing poorly now is essential for better performance later. It is so deeply counterintuitive that it fools the learners themselves."
