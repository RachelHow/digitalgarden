# The Future Belongs to Deep Generalists

Today's world calls for range, not specialisation. Narrow specialisation can suppress creative thinking and problem-solving abilities.

A deep generalist is someone who has a useful blend of knowledge depth and knowledge breadth. Generalists are good at adapting. Changes, therefore, turn into opportunities. Most of humankind's significant breakthroughs haven't come from specialists, they have come from multi-faceted individuals. Famous deep generalists include Leonardo Da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and Marie Curie.

The questions is, should we become specialists or polymaths? Is there a balance we should pursue? Every day, we have to decide where to invest our time — do we become better at what we do or learn something new?[^s1]

  - “We learn who we are in practice, not in theory.”
  - “The challenge we all face is how to maintain the benefits of breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes, even demands, hyperspecialization”
  - “The precise person you are now is fleeting, just like all the other people you’ve been. That feels like the most unexpected result, but it is also the most well documented.”
  - “it is difficult to accept that the best learning road is slow, and that doing poorly now is essential for better performance later. It is so deeply counterintuitive that it fools the learners themselves."
