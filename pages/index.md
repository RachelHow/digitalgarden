## What's a mind garden
This digital garden is a public notebook where I can freely explore ideas, thoughts, resources, questions, unknowns, and stuff I find useful and interesting. My garden embrace imperfection and is filled with interconnected ideas where it will change, evolve, and grow over time. It is unorganized on purposeâ€”because what's life without a little chaos? Read the [[terms-of-service]] of this garden.

## Why am I doing this
I believe the best way to learn is to learn, share and exchange ideas in public because we're all constantly a work-in-progress. My main purposes are:
- To practice mindful learning
- To connect my learnings and thoughts that lead to new ideas
- To give back by helping others learn
